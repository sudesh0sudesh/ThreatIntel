    "description": "[Conti](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0575) can use <code>CreateIoCompletionPort()</code>, <code>PostQueuedCompletionStatus()</code>, and <code>GetQueuedCompletionPort()</code> to rapidly encrypt files, excluding those with the extensions of .exe, .dll, and .lnk. It has used a different AES-256 encryption key per file with a bundled RAS-4096 public encryption key that is unique for each victim. [Conti](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0575) can use “Windows Restart Manager” to ensure files are unlocked and open for encryption.(Citation: Cybereason Conti Jan 2021)(Citation: CarbonBlack Conti July 2020)(Citation: Cybleinc Conti January 2020)(Citation: CrowdStrike Wizard Spider October 2020)",
